# FiveM-StealthDM
A WIP of a stealth gamemode for FiveM. Spawns players with random weapons and provides targets for assasination (visualized via mugshots).


I stopped working on this project some time ago and decided to release the code so that some people can use it to create something similiar/finish this project/get some inspiration. If you decide to use this code - feel free to do with it whatever you like.

How it works:
Players are spawned randomly (map.lua should be modified so that players spawn in a close range, pretty hidden), they are given random pedestrian model and random weapons (gun, melee + sometimes a nade). The instructions appear on screen. The mugshot of target player's model is shown via mugshot above the map. Player's aim is to kill the target without getting killed by other assasins.
